# Charlotte Hornets Active Directory Project

## Description
In this post, I will be detailing how I installed/created two virtual machines (VMs), used Active Directory on one of my VMs to create users/organizational units (OUs)/security groups all pertaining to the Charlotte Hornets. Using these users/OUs/security groups, I was able to create shared files and then map these files for certain users. Lastly, I will showcase how I resolved a hypothetical Help Desk Ticket regarding a user being locked out of their account after too many incorrect passwords. 

This post will be broken down into sections titled VMs Setup, Active Directory, and Help Desk with a Sources section at the very end of course. I will provide screenshots throughout the Active Directory and Help Desk sections to further illustrate some points. With this preable out of the way, lets begin with the Setup section.

## Setup
To be upfront and honest, I mimicked Josh Madakor's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsI8hJmggI&forced">video</a> to setup my two VMs. I did not follow his steps in regards to running the Powershell script that created roughly 1,000 users since I planned on creating users associated with the Charlotte Hornets Organization. Everything else I essentially followed to a T. I had to recreate this VM multiple times, so I did learn how to do it without the video eventually.

## Active Directory
I cannot find the reddit post I found in regards to how to best learn Active Directory in their opinion, but the person's post detailed how they mimicked their favorite TV show to create users/organizational units/security groups based on the show. This allowed them to learn quite a bit about Active Directory while also keeping the learning entertaining since it related to one of their interests. I absolutely love the Charlotte Hornets (sadly), so I figured why not do an Active Directory inspired project related to them.

I began by looking up people associated with both the Basketball Operations side of the Charlotte Hornets as well as the Business Operations side. This would allow me to create different OUs and security groups to then allow me to have distinct shared files within these groups. I will have my sources down below where I found the staff associated with the business side of the Charlotte Hornets, the medical staff, the coaching staff and the players, but here is a screenshot showcasing the users/OUs/security groups.<br>
