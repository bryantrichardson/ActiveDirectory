# Charlotte Hornets Active Directory Project

## Description
In this post, I will be detailing how I installed/created two virtual machines (VMs), used Active Directory on one of my VMs to create users/organizational units (OUs)/security groups all pertaining to the Charlotte Hornets. Using these users/OUs/security groups, I was able to create shared files and then map these files for certain users. Lastly, I will showcase how I resolved a hypothetical Help Desk Ticket regarding a user being locked out of their account after too many incorrect passwords. 

This post will be broken down into sections titled VMs Setup, Active Directory, and Help Desk with a Sources section at the very end of course. I will provide screenshots throughout the Active Directory and Help Desk sections to further illustrate some points. With this preable out of the way, lets begin with the Setup section.

## Setup
To be upfront and honest, I mimicked Josh Madakor's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsI8hJmggI&forced"video</a> to setup my two VMs.
